To effectively respond to the pandemic, ADB assessed the public finance capabilities of DMCs for each CPRO project, and designed measures to ensure the proper use of emergency funds. To help DMCs meet fiscal challenges while preserving service delivery given the added financial pressures of the pandemic, ADB provided substantial policy support for tax and customs collection, budgeting, debt sustainability, reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and improvements in local governance.\",\"type\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":\"The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need to boost revenue collection by broadening countries’ tax bases. Among a number of commitments in 2020 supporting domestic resource mobilization, ADB provided regional technical assistance to help DMCs strengthen property tax management to enhance local revenue and service delivery. This is concentrating on improving property registration and valuation and providing capacity building in local tax policy and administration. The bank is providing focused assistance to enhance domestic resource mobilization in Pakistan, the Philippines, and Mongolia. ADB is also supporting DMCs to build a sound tax and fiscal policy geared toward ensuring that digital businesses pay a fair share of tax.\",\"type\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":\"In September 2020, ADB announced the establishment of a regional hub on domestic resource mobilization and international tax cooperation.
